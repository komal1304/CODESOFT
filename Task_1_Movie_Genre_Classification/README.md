# 🎬 Movie Genre Classification (CODSOFT ML Internship – Task 1)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Movie Genre Classification system** using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The objective is to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary by converting textual data into numerical form and applying classification algorithms.

This task was completed as part of the **Machine Learning Internship at CODSOFT**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a machine learning model that can:

* Analyze movie plot summaries
* Understand textual patterns
* Predict the correct movie genre

This project demonstrates how NLP techniques can be used for text classification problems in real-world applications.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used contains:

* **Plot** → Movie story/description (text data)
* **Genre** → Target category (Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.)

The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed before training the model.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading

The dataset was imported using pandas and explored to understand its structure.

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Text data was cleaned by:

* Converting text to lowercase
* Removing special characters and numbers
* Preparing text for feature extraction

### 3️⃣ Feature Extraction (TF-IDF)

TF-IDF Vectorization was used to convert text into numerical form.
This helps the model understand important words and patterns in movie plots.

### 4️⃣ Train-Test Split

The dataset was divided into training and testing sets:

* Training data → used to train model
* Testing data → used to evaluate performance

### 5️⃣ Model Building

A **Logistic Regression** classification model was trained on the processed data to predict movie genres.

### 6️⃣ Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:

* Accuracy score
* Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)

This helped measure how well the model predicts genres.

### 7️⃣ Prediction

The trained model can predict the genre of new movie plots provided by the user.

## 📈 Result

The machine learning model successfully predicts movie genres based on plot summaries with good accuracy.
This demonstrates the effectiveness of combining NLP techniques with classification algorithms.

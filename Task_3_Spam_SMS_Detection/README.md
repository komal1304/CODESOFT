📩 Spam SMS Detection using Machine Learning
CODSOFT ML Internship – Task 4
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Spam SMS Detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) based on their textual content.

Spam detection is widely used in email services, messaging platforms, and communication systems to filter unwanted messages and improve user security.

This project was completed as part of the CODSOFT Machine Learning Internship.

🎯 Objective

To develop a machine learning model that:

Reads SMS text messages

Understands textual patterns

Classifies messages as spam or legitimate

📊 Dataset

The dataset used contains:

Label → spam or ham

Message → actual SMS text

The dataset was preprocessed and cleaned before training the model.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

🧠 Machine Learning Concepts Used

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Text preprocessing

TF-IDF vectorization

Classification model (Naive Bayes)

Model evaluation

🔄 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading

The dataset was loaded and explored using pandas.

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Removed unnecessary columns

Cleaned text data

Converted labels into numerical form

3️⃣ Feature Extraction

TF-IDF vectorization was used to convert text into numerical features so the machine learning model could process it.

4️⃣ Train-Test Split

The dataset was divided into training and testing sets for model building and evaluation.

5️⃣ Model Training

A Naive Bayes classifier was used to train the model for spam detection.

6️⃣ Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:

Accuracy score

Classification report

Confusion matrix

📈 Result

The model achieved high accuracy in detecting spam messages and successfully classified SMS as spam or ham.
